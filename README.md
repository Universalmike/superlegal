# 🧠 Super Legal – Multi-Document Legal RAG Chat App

Super Legal is an AI-powered legal assistant built with **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Google Gemini**.  
It allows users to ask questions about different Nigerian laws (e.g., the Constitution, Labour Law Act) and get answers in natural language.  
The system uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with **FAISS** for semantic search over legal documents.
